1. **Redux Fundamentals Recap (Short & Clear)**  
    - What is Redux and why do we use it?  

    **Redux Core Concepts:**  
    - Store  
    - Actions  
    - Reducers  
    - State  
    - Dispatch  
    - Selectors  

---

2. **Project Setup**  
    - Installing Redux-related libraries:  
      - `@reduxjs/toolkit` (RTK)  
      - `react-redux`  
      - TypeScript types: `@types/react-redux`  
    - Project folder structure suggestions  

---

3. **Create and Configure the Store**  
    - How to create a store with `configureStore`  
    - Store typing (`RootState`, `AppDispatch`)  

---

4. **Create a Basic Slice**  
    - Creating a slice with `createSlice`  
    - Writing reducers & actions inside slices  
    - Initial state typing with TypeScript  

---

5. **Connecting Redux to React**  
    - `<Provider>` setup  
    - Accessing state with `useSelector` (with proper TypeScript types)  
    - Dispatching actions with `useDispatch` (with proper typing)  

---

6. **Advanced Slice Usage**  
    - Handling asynchronous logic with `createAsyncThunk`  
    - `extraReducers` for async states (loading, error, success)  
    - Managing loading states  

---

7. **Best Practices**  
    - Slices per feature vs. global reducer files  
    - Immutable updates with Immer (built into RTK)  
    - How to keep your state normalized and clean  

---

8. **Custom Typed Hooks**  
    - Create `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` to avoid repeating type annotations  

---

9. **Middleware**  
    - Intro to Redux Middleware  
    - Example custom middleware for logging or analytics  

---

10. **Redux DevTools**  
     - Enabling Redux DevTools for debugging  

---

11. **Redux Persist (Optional)**  
     - How to persist Redux state in `localStorage`/`sessionStorage`  

---

12. **Working with Complex Nested State**  
     - Updating deeply nested state in reducers  
     - Normalizing state structures  

---

13. **Error Handling Patterns**  
     - Error handling in reducers  
     - Showing errors in the UI  

---

14. **Performance Optimization**  
     - Using `React.memo` with Redux  
     - Selector memoization with `reselect` or `createSelector` from RTK  

---

15. **Testing Redux**  
     - Testing slices (reducers and actions)  
     - Testing async thunks  
     - Testing components that use Redux
